## 📌 Project Description

This program runs in a loop and asks the user to enter a number.

### Program behavior:
- If the number is **negative** → the program stops.
- If the number is **even** → a message is shown and the loop continues.
- If the number is **odd** → the program shows:
  - the number itself
  - whether it is even or odd
  - number of digits
  - whether it is a multiple of 5
